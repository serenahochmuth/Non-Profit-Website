Project 4: Final Website Project with Basic Javascript functions, Search and additional tools

Assignment: students will design a real-world website of 10 pages based on the Project 2 proposal/plan. Students will implement javascript snippets, form validation, icons and search function.

For this project, I created a 10 page website for a small nonprofit I worked with in 2018; The Philippines Project. I used the preprocessor SASS for a more optimized and quicker code.
